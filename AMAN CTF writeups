$ Incomplete Password 100 points:

They captured the following sha1 hash, which was used by the hacker:

827d1057ad7258b180efca5e9cc25795a1a5f622

They looked further into the network logs and only found the first few plain characters of the password the hacker used:

Om@nYg

Use your programming skills to brute-force the remaining part of the password, knowing that the system the hacker was able to compromise has the following password requirements:

Password must not exceed 9 characters
Must contain lower & capital case characters
Alphanumeric characters are allowed
Only * & @ % ^ + _ special characters are allowed
The password is the flag.

Here we can build a program from scratch that calculates the sha1 hash of Om@nYg and compare it to the given hash, if true then SuGoi!! if not then 
add characters that follow the password policy given in the task.
In my case I'm a bit lazy to complete such a code but you can have a glimps to Madiox writeup code which is well ordered and neat..
However, stone solved it in 2 ways:
